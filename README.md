## About Me

I am building structured cybersecurity lab environments with a strong focus on defensive security, isolation architecture and threat analysis.

My current focus lies in Blue Team practices such as:

- Virtualization-based lab isolation
- Malware analysis workflows
- Threat modeling
- Secure configuration hardening
- Attack surface reduction

In parallel, I am expanding my knowledge in penetration testing to better understand adversarial techniques and strengthen defensive capabilities.
